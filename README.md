My name is Fowobaje Oluwatomi, I am 16years old. 
I graduated High School this year, actually a few months ago and I am taking a gap year and will be enrolling into Unversity next year.
During my  gap year I am studying Backend Development at Stutern and I have a feeling that I am the youngest one here
